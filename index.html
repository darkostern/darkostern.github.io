  <div class="resume-date"><p>By learning a sequence of actions that maximize the expected reward, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) brought significant performance improvements in many areas including games, robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision. It was DeepMind, a small and little-known company in 2013, that achieved a breakthrough in the world of reinforcement learning as they implemented a system that could learn to play many classic Atari games with human or even superhuman performance. Sill, it was until recently that DRL started to appear also in medical image applications for landmark detection, automatic view planning from 3D MR images, or active breast lesion detection. <p>

  <div class="resume-date"><p>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have recently shown outstanding performance on image classification and object detection tasks due to their powerful multiscale filters. The dominant filters used in building DCNN architectures are only transitionally invariant, which is not optimal when the problem is rotation equivalent, as it is the case in e.g. cells detection and tracking task. Thus, by explicitly encoding the expected rotational invariance of the object in the image, the complexity of the problem is decreased, leading to a reduction in the size of the required model. <p>

    <p>While standard deep convolution neural networks have recently shown unprecedented results that even go beyond human performance in computer vision tasks like classification, segmentation or detection, these methods are not capable of capturing model uncertainty. Being able to provide a prediction together with its uncertainty is of crucial importance for many medical applications that are related to decision making. Bayesian probability theory offers us mathematically grounded tools to reason about model uncertainty. Therefore, Bayesian deep learning, as a field at the intersection between deep learning and Bayesian probability theory, has recently attracted great interest of both computer vision and medical image communities. <p>

    <div>Christian Payer, <b>Darko Štern</b>, Horst Bischof, Martin Urschler</div>
    <div><i>Medical Image Analysis (2019)</i><p></p></div>
    <div>In many medical image analysis applications, only a limited amount of training data is available due to the costs of image acquisition and the large manual annotation effort required from experts. Training recent state-of-the-art machine learning methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from small datasets is a challenging task. In this work on anatomical landmark localization, we propose a CNN architecture that learns to split the localization task into two simpler sub-problems, reducing the overall need for large training datasets. Our fully convolutional SpatialConfiguration-Net (SCN) learns this simplification due to multiplying the heatmap predictions of its two components and by training the network in an end-to-end manner. Thus, the SCN dedicates one component to locally accurate but ambiguous candidate predictions, while the other component improves robustness to ambiguities by incorporating the spatial configuration of landmarks. In our extensive experimental evaluation, we show that the proposed SCN outperforms related methods in terms of landmark localization error on a variety of size-limited 2D and 3D landmark localization datasets, i.e., hand radiographs, lateral cephalograms, hand MRIs, and spine CTs.</div>

    <div><b>Darko Stern</b>, Christian Payer, Nicola Giuliani, Martin Urschler</div>
    <div><i>IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (2018)</i><p></p></div>
    <div>Age estimation from radiologic data is an important topic both in clinical medicine as well as in forensic applications, where it is used to assess unknown chronological age or to discriminate minors from adults. In this work, we propose an automatic multi-factorial age estimation method based on MRI data of hand, clavicle and teeth to extend the maximal age range from up to 19 years, as commonly used for age assessment based on hand bones, to up to 25 years, when combined with clavicle bones and wisdom teeth. Fusing age-relevant information from all three anatomical sites, our method utilizes a deep convolutional neural network that is trained on a dataset of 322 subjects in the age range between 13 and 25 years, to achieve a mean absolute prediction error in regressing chronological age of 1.01 ± 0.74 years. Furthermore, when used for majority age classification, we show that a classifier derived from thresholding our regression based predictor is better suited than a classifier directly trained with a classification loss, especially when taking into account that cases of minors being wrongly classified as adults need to be minimized. In conclusion, we overcome the limitations of the multi-factorial methods currently used in forensic practice, i.e., dependency on ionizing radiation, subjectivity in quantifying age-relevant information, and lack of an established approach to fuse this information from individual anatomical sites.</div>

    <div>Franz Thaler, Kerstin Hammernik, Christian Payer, Martin Urschler, <b>Darko Štern</b></div>
    <div><i>IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (2018)</i><p></p></div>
    <div>We propose a 2D computed tomography (CT) slice image reconstruction method from a limited number of projection images using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (wGAN). Our wGAN optimizes the 2D CT image reconstruction by utilizing an adversarial loss to improve the perceived image quality as well as an   𝐿1  content loss to enforce structural similarity to the target image. We evaluate our wGANs using different weight factors between the two loss functions and compare to a convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized on 𝐿1 and the Filtered Backprojection (FBP) method. The evaluation shows that the results generated by the machine learning based approaches are substantially better than those from the FBP method. In contrast to the blurrier looking images generated by the CNNs trained on 𝐿1, the wGANs results appear sharper and seem to contain more structural information. We show that a certain amount of projection data is needed to get a correct representation of the anatomical correspondences.</div>

    <div>Christian Payer, <b>Darko Štern</b>, Thomas Neff, Horst Bischof, Martin Urschler</div>
    <div><i>International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (2018)</i><p></p></div>
    <div>Different to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation assigns unique labels to each individual instance of the same class. In this work, we propose a novel recurrent fully convolutional network architecture for tracking such instance segmentations over time. The network architecture incorporates convolutional gated recurrent units (ConvGRU) into a stacked hourglass network to utilize temporal video information. Furthermore, we train the network with a novel embedding loss based on cosine similarities, such that the network predicts unique embeddings for every instance throughout videos. Afterwards, these embeddings are clustered among subsequent video frames to create the final tracked instance segmentations. We evaluate the recurrent hourglass network by segmenting left ventricles in MR videos of the heart, where it outperforms a network that does not incorporate video information. Furthermore, we show applicability of the cosine embedding loss for segmenting leaf instances on still images of plants. Finally, we evaluate the framework for instance segmentation and tracking on six datasets of the ISBI celltracking challenge, where it shows state-of-the-art performance.</div>
