      <p><p>We at LBI and ICG are constantly looking for students with an interest in medical image analysis, as well as the use of machine learning and computer vision in novel and established clinical and forensic applications. This page lists specific open student projects on a master and bachelor level. Students coming with their own research ideas are also welcome to get in contact! Please be aware that work on students projects is usually not financially covered by our side.</p>

    <p>While standard deep convolution neural networks have recently shown unprecedented results that even go beyond human performance in computer vision tasks like classification, segmentation or detection, these methods are not capable of capturing model uncertainty. Being able to provide a prediction together with its uncertainty is of crucial importance for many medical applications that are related to decision making. Bayesian probability theory offers us mathematically grounded tools to reason about model uncertainty. Therefore, Bayesian deep learning, as a field at the intersection between deep learning and Bayesian probability theory, has recently attracted great interest of both computer vision and medical image communities. <p>
