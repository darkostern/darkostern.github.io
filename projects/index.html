      <p><p>We at LBI and ICG are constantly looking for students with an interest in medical image analysis, as well as the use of machine learning and computer vision in novel and established clinical and forensic applications. This page lists specific open student projects on a master and bachelor level. Students coming with their own research ideas are also welcome to get in contact! Please be aware that work on students projects is usually not financially covered by our side.</p>

    <p>While standard deep convolution neural networks have recently shown unprecedented results that even go beyond human performance in computer vision tasks like classification, segmentation or detection, these methods are not capable of capturing model uncertainty. Being able to provide a prediction together with its uncertainty is of crucial importance for many medical applications that are related to decision making. Bayesian probability theory offers us mathematically grounded tools to reason about model uncertainty. Therefore, Bayesian deep learning, as a field at the intersection between deep learning and Bayesian probability theory, has recently attracted great interest of both computer vision and medical image communities. <p>

  <div class="resume-date"><p>By learning a sequence of actions that maximize the expected reward, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) brought significant performance improvements in many areas including games, robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision. It was DeepMind, a small and little-known company in 2013, that achieved a breakthrough in the world of reinforcement learning as they implemented a system that could learn to play many classic Atari games with human or even superhuman performance. Sill, it was until recently that DRL started to appear also in medical image applications for landmark detection, automatic view planning from 3D MR images, or active breast lesion detection. <p>

  <div class="resume-date"><p>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have recently shown outstanding performance on image classification and object detection tasks due to their powerful multiscale filters. The dominant filters used in building DCNN architectures are only transitionally invariant, which is not optimal when the problem is rotation equivalent, as it is the case in e.g. cells detection and tracking task. Thus, by explicitly encoding the expected rotational invariance of the object in the image, the complexity of the problem is decreased, leading to a reduction in the size of the required model. <p>
